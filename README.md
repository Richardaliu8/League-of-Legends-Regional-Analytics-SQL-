# League-of-Legends-Regional-Analytics-SQL-
Project Overview  
This project focuses on the analysis of League of Legends gameplay data to uncover regional differences and champion performance across various global sectors. By constructing a robust relational database and employing detailed statistical analysis, this initiative seeks to provide strategic insights that can help in enhancing game balance and player engagement.  

Features  
Database Creation and Population: Developed a structured relational database in MySQL from multiple CSV files containing detailed gameplay statistics such as champion performance, games played, win rates, and more across different regions (EUW, NA, KR, JP, TW).  
Data Integration: Merged comprehensive gameplay data from distinct regions, creating a unified platform for cross-regional analysis. This includes normalization processes to minimize data redundancy and ensure integrity.  
Advanced SQL Queries: Utilized complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights from the data, focusing on comparative analysis of gameplay metrics across regions.  
Analytical Questions: Addressed key business questions to evaluate gameplay balance, including analyses of KDA ratios, pick and ban rates, and win rates across champions and regions.  
Data Visualization: Employed visualization tools to represent data findings effectively, facilitating easier interpretation of complex statistical information.  
Performance Metrics: Analyzed champion performance metrics to determine regional gameplay trends and champion popularity, which can influence game development and marketing strategies.  

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to leverage detailed gameplay data from League of Legends to analyze regional differences and champion usage statistics. The insights derived from this analysis aim to assist game developers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to enhance player experience and game balance.
